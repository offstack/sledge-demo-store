# Overview

Sledge is a multipurpose app that empowers Shopify and Shopify Plus merchants to boost their development time and grow their brands. Sledge provides important features that merchants can use in just a few minutes while merchants can focus on building other store features.

Sledge supports [Liquid](https://docs.sledge-app.com/installation/liquid) by default, so it will work on your theme. However if you are using a headless storefront, Sledge also supports [Hydrogen](https://docs.sledge-app.com/installation/hydrogen) and [Next.js Commerce](https://docs.sledge-app.com/installation/nextjs). Sledge also works on no-code tools like [Webflow](https://docs.sledge-app.com/installation/webflow).
